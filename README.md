# Optimization
Optimization of error term by Graph of $\log\left(\frac{4(2-2\sigma)}{3\beta}\right)$ and $\psi\left(\frac{4}{3\beta} + 1\right)$ when $\sigma = 0.6$.
In my thesis, in the unsmoothing method, the choice of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ plays a role in determining the size of the error term and also, we can analyze this error term to understand the best choices for parameters $\alpha,\beta$. To find the optimal $\beta$, I used the graph of my equation with respect to $\beta$. To do this, I'll choose $\sigma = 0.6$ and plot the equation for $\beta$. Once we find the optimal $\beta$ and then determine the corresponding $\alpha$. For $\sigma = 0.6$, the approximation optimal value for $\beta$ is $0.1$ and the corresponding optimal value for $\alpha$ is $10$.
